# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:.<br><br>
I am a self-motivated, professional Software Engineer:desktop_computer: with four years of work experience in mobile:iphone: and web application development. I have worked with a leading multi-national company, a start-up, and a Nordic-Indian company as an application developer in India:india:.

I moved to New Zealand:new_zealand: in March 2020 to be with my partner and am currently living in Christchurch. I am actively looking for a role in the IT industry at the moment and open to all kinds of opportunities. I am also willing to relocate to anywhere in New Zealand given a right opportunity.
